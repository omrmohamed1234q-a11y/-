🚀 Prompt for Replit – Delivery System Integration

I want you to extend my app by adding a Delivery Panel (Driver App) similar to delivery systems.

Customer Panel (Already exists)

Customers can add products to cart, checkout, and place orders.

Orders should have a status flow:

Pending → Accepted → Picked Up → Delivered.

Customers must be able to track their order in real-time and see delivery updates instantly.

Delivery Panel (Driver App)

Create a new panel for delivery drivers (الكباتن) with the following features:

Authentication for Drivers

Drivers login separately (different role from normal users).

Store driver accounts in Supabase/Firebase with metadata (Name, Phone, Vehicle Type, Status Online/Offline).

Order Management

Show a list of available orders in their assigned region.

Driver can:

Accept Order ✅

Reject Order ❌

Once accepted, order status updates to Accepted and becomes invisible to other drivers.

Order Workflow Buttons

Button: "استلام الطلب من المتجر" → changes order status to Picked Up.

Button: "تم التوصيل" → changes order status to Delivered.

Order Details View

Customer Name, Address, Phone (click to call).

Product details (what is being delivered).

Delivery notes (if provided).

Live Location Tracking

Driver shares GPS location via Google Maps API.

Customer can see driver’s movement live in their app.

Notifications

Push notification to customer when:

Driver accepts order.

Driver is on the way.

Driver marks as delivered.

Admin Panel Enhancements

Add a Drivers Section:

Create, Edit, Remove driver accounts.

See drivers' status (Online/Offline).

Assign orders manually to a specific driver (optional).

Orders Dashboard

Admin sees all orders with live status.

Track which driver is delivering.

Override statuses if needed.

Tech Notes



Location: Google Maps API for driver tracking.

Notifications: as implemented in the app.



⚡ Please implement this end-to-end:

Extend DB schema with Drivers and Orders tables.

Build Delivery Panel with login + order workflow.

Connect with Customer panel for live updates.

Enhance Admin Panel to manage drivers and track orders.
